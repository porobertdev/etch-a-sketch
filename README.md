## About

This project is part of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/https://github.com/TheOdinProject) curriculum. The project's lesson can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketchhttps:/).

I've made a [Figma mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/PhgrsZfWZ0czfXj2xqhL0K/Etch-a-Sketch-%40TheOdinProject?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&mode=design&t=9mEftXM4Mq5QeMWr-1) that I used as a starting point. Apart from the title, the website is pretty much identic with the mockup.
